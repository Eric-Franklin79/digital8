<h2>Color Car Driving</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Manuever a stunt car around to color the canvas they're driving on.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
The player to be creative and enjoy a slow paced coloring game.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
Art and creativite sandbox game.
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
Press buttons to move the car and to change the color.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
I wanted to create a color game where you didnt get to see the whole picture you were making, so you have to remember what you have previously drawn
 and at the end you get to see if your idea matched what you had drawn.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
The game features 6 different colors to choose from and 3 different actions for the car.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
You are controlling a stunt car.
</li>


<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Anyone who wants to draw.
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
The player controlls the play time.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Driving on a line that is down lets you move drive to parts you have been too without messing up your image.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
I created all of my own assets.
</li>

<li><strong>Game Themes:</strong>
Clickable Buttons, Mouse, Sandbox, Artist Play Style, Deterministic movement and Random Images For Different Players.
